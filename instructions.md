# AshVM instruction list

This table groups all available AshVM instructions.

They give the matching AshASM name, the full name, a short description, a stack prestate and poststate (warning : those does not count possible other modifications on the stack as sget, sset would do), the stack value order (i.e. what the top of the stack and the second value of the stack matches to) and what the value is used for.
